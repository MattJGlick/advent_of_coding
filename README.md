# Advent of Code

My Advent of Code solutions for 2015-2018. I was introduced to this in 2017 and loved it! I went back and did a portion
of 2015 and 2016 as warm ups for 2017 days. Most of the solutions have my input files along with them. In some cases I
cleaned the code up _a little bit_ but for the most part I was just trying to get the solutions as fast as possible.

Current best rankings:

1 star: 227

2 star: 141

Hoping to break the top 100 leaderboard this year!
